## The game concept

Play alone or in teams against your opponents in 1vs1. Choose your own or other kits and find out in fair fights who is
the better one. The kit can be freely assembled from everything that the creative inventory, anvil and enchantment table
have to offer.
"Hackerkits" can be created via the black market vendor, these contain modified items. Work your way up the career
ladder in our ranked system and become the highest-ranked player on the server. Challenge other players or teams or take
part in a tournament and prove yourself to other players.

## And that's how it works

- In the kit area, you can create your kit and change it as often as you like.
- With a right-click on the queue, kit settings and options can be selected and changed.
- By left-clicking with the diamond sword on the queue zombie you can enter the queue.
- A left-click on a player challenges him to a duel, a right-click invites him to join a team.
- Force the end of a fight with '/endmatch'. You can find more information [here](#endmatch).
- Blocks burst after 15 seconds in every tournament and ranked match, in regular games when `/endmatch` is used.
- Clicking on the nether star in the hotbar provides an overview of all arenas in the lobby
- With a right-click on a player currently in a fight, you can watch the fight from his perspective.
-  Via `/settings` you can view settings for queuing, kits, maps and fights as well as various options for the lobby
  and chat.
- To find even fairer matches even faster, you can play against players on all servers in the global queue.
- All fight statistics can be viewed with /statsmenu or by clicking on the stats skeleton in the lobby.

## Ranked system

Work your way up the ladder in our ranked system and reach the highest rank on the server.
There are a total of 10 ranks to achieve. All players have an assigned value in 1vs1, the ranked points.
If you win a match, they increase, if you lose a match, points are reduced. Your rank is determined by the amount of points you have.
The exact point limits for the individual ranks can be shown ingame with the command `/ranks`. All information about your current rank and points can be found under `/season`.

| Rank | Points | |
| :------: | :------: | ----- |
| <b><span class='minecraft-darkgray'>1</span></b> | 0 - 1399 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-darkgray'>2</span></b> | 1400 - 1499 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-gray'>3</span></b> | 1500 - 1599 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-white'>4</span></b> | 1600 - 1699 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-green'>5</span></b> | 1700 - 1799 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-darkgreen'>6</span></b> | 1800 - 1899 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-lightpurple'>7</span></b> | 1900 - 1999 |
| <b><span class='minecraft-darkpurple'>8</span></b> | 2000+ |

### Calculation of the points

For each of the 6 ranked kits of a season there is a separate ranking list. The Elo is calculated independently for each ranked kit.
Your global ranked points, which determine your rank, are the average of your ranked points in each kit.
You start with 1300 Elo in each kit. For winning games you get Elo credited, for losing games you get Elo deducted.
How exactly the Elo is calculated in our system, you can find out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

### Seasons

At the end of each season, all ranked leaderboards and points are reset, the top players of the last season are
displayed in the PvP lobby. All statistics (including yours) of the last seasons can be viewed in-game
with `/season [number]`. In each season 6 ranked kits are offered. You can see which ones are currently available and
how long the current season will last with `/season`. The 6 kits consist of 3 kits that are given by the team and 3 kits
the community can vote for. This voting takes place in the last week of the previous season.

## Win streaks

Earn additional Pixel with win streaks and buy great items in the Pixelshop with them. Players
with [premium](/ranks/premium/) gain more Pixel.

| Win streak | Pixel |
| ------ | ------ |
| 3 wins | 3 Pixel |
| 6 wins | 6 Pixel |
| 10 wins | 10 Pixel |
| 15 wins | 10 Pixel |
| 20 wins | 15 Pixel |
| 30 wins | 30 Pixel | 
| 40 wins | 30 Pixel |
| 50 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 60 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 70 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 80 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 90 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 100 wins | 50 Pixel |

After 100 consecutive victories, the rewards do not increase, you will receive the same reward after every 10
consecutive victories. With the command '/winstreak' you can view your current win streak. Note: Your win streak only
increases if you play via the queue.

## FFA
FFA is a tournament format where all players fight against each other on a shared map with the same starting equipment. Depending on the settings of the tournament creator, 
the players have multiple lives. With a new life, they get another chance, but they donâ€™t get any new materials. Therefore, the tactical distribution and use of the equipment 
is an important part of the game. As the name (free for all) suggests, each player fights alone against the others, so any form of assistance or favoritism for another opponent is 
forbidden during the whole tournament.

## Friday tournaments

Every Friday at 20:00 there is a big Timolia tournament. It can be entered with `/join Timolia` from any 1vs1 server.
The tournament is broadcasted live by a streamer. The respective streamers and kits will be announced
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TimoliaTeam) and the [Timolia Discord](/discord/). The winner will have the opportunity
to win the [MVP rank](/ranks/premium/) for one month. If he accepts the risk-match against the streamer and wins it, he
can even win 2 months. However, if he loses, he only gets half a month. Additionally, the top 3 receive a medal and a
respective subtitle. Also, every player who makes it to the final server will get 3 days Pro!

## End match

With `/endmatch` the end of a fight can be forced. Once this command has been executed, a fight will only last one
minute. Whoever was closest to the middle on average in the last 30 seconds wins the fight. This command cannot be used
in a tournament, of course.
`/endmatch` can only be used after a specified time which is different for different kits.  
Here you can find an overview of the minimum playing times until end match:

| Kit        | Time         |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1Bar       | 60 seconds  |
| Basic      | 45 seconds  |
| NoHitDelay | 60 seconds  |
| OP         | 60 seconds  |
| PotPVP     | 300 seconds |
| Sniper     | 300 seconds |
| Soup       | 300 seconds |
| Standard   | 45 seconds  |
| UHC        | 180 seconds |
| SG         | 180 seconds |
| Own kits   | 30 seconds |

## Premium features

  selecting a map pool, normal users have access to one and premium players up to 5 slots depending on their rank.
